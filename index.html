            <h2>Working Principle</h2>
            <p>
                This clock measures time based on the speed of light and the size of the universe. 
                Instead of using Earth's rotation, it calculates how long a single particle of light (a photon) 
                takes to travel the average distance between two galaxies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because our universe is constantly stretching and expanding, that distance gets longer 
                in every new cycle—or "Epoch"—meaning the photon has farther to travel and the 
                clock's "ticks" gradually stretch out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this cosmic expansion is so incredibly subtle that the clock would have to run constantly for over a million years before a human would notice even a single 1-second delay in its timing.
            </p>
